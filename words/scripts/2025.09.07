i gradually grew to dislike ratings. the arbitruary methods people use to signal how well they like or dislike certain forms of media. the more i read, the more i become more sensitive to the author's feelings. conducting a review, in my perspective, is selfish on behalf of the reader. as if the author is writing for the reader's sake. there are a multitude of biases, writing styles, and forms of story telling that a single work cannot account for all of them. given this, the expectation loosely implies that the author must conduct his work in a way to reach the furthest audience. not only does this stretch the work thin, but renders it difficult to embed an author's feelings into what they write. why should an author bear this burden? at some point i stopped giving ratings to books altogether. rather than criticizing the piece, i look to find what i may have missed. does the author share my intentions? what motivation do they possess?

when i rationalize my behavior this seems to be the justification. essentially, put yourself in the author's shoes. if i wrote this novel, how would i feel if it was criticized? what prevents myself from writing is that i must accept the fact that some ideas may be juvenile. the type of literature you would read and think to yourself, "what are you a child?" when lost in thought, i have no hesitation to ramble on loosely related tangents. however, as soon as begin to write do i have a tied tongue.

this entry begins a long list of notes that i intend to write as a substitute for my thoughts in order to better myself. i feel as if i think too much, and all of those words in my head are wasted energy until put onto paper. the goal is to be able to write without hesitation, a one-take of sorts in the form of writing. ideally no revision necessary. even if there are mispellings, grammar mistakes, or contradictions, i want to leave all of my inner monologues out on display. in the present, i would not wish for a soul to take their time to reading my ramblings. please feel free to rate them a 0/10 and to dismiss what i have to say as a waste of time. i would prefer it this way.
