i never understood why i lacked such creative capabilities. it seems that from an onlooker perspective, i'm able to recognize the fundamentals, abstract ideas, and execution styles in all forms of art. however, once i give the medium a try i fail miserably. i suppose it has to do with experience, but i've never replicated this flaw in anything else but art.

perhaps im hardwired to view the process of creating art as formulaic. as if there are guidelines and techniques to follow and going outside of those will lead to poor creations. and yet i haven't a clue what such guidelines are. until i witness art created by another, but only for a fleeting moment do i realize what makes their art so unique and expressive.

i suppose that is why i begun to write: to see if i can finally break that barrier.
