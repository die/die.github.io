i love studying the creation and organization of words. new ways to permutate sentences to communicate unique ideas and emotions.

and yet i could never get into poetry. it may be due to my experience witnessing poetry that others create. each poem feels as if it tries to emulate the past notable authors, compacting as much detail and literary techniques as possible into a few words per line. these poems feel artifical as if they spent hours contemplating how to write what they want to express with the proper words to fit the elegance of a poem. if poems allowed more leeway for rambling, irrational tangents to complement any vividness in detail i would like them more. if they exercised independent thought to express what the creator is truly thinking i would like them more. maybe if they used fore!g#n, unu__sual words i would like them more. maybe if THEY were more self-awarE i would like them more. m4yBE iF i could writee THEM mys3lf i woul_d like them m0re.

but then the poem wouldn't be taken seriously
